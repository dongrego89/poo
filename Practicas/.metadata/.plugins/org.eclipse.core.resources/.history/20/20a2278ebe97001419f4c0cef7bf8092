// A sample program demonstrating using Google C++ testing framework.
//
// This sample shows how to write a more complex unit test for a class
// that has multiple member functions.
//
// Usually, it's a good idea to have one test for each method in your
// class.  You don't have to do that exactly, but it helps to keep
// your tests organized.  You may also throw in additional tests as
// needed.
